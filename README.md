## Making edges

Transforming the data in the yml files into a sane set of edges for
igraph to work with is done with the make_edges script.

It has some dependencies that need to be installed so there is a
requirements file to take care of that:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
./make_edges --help
```
